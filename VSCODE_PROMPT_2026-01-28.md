# Picobot Project — VS Code Session

I'm continuing work on a Picobot optimization project that I've been developing with Claude Opus. All context is in the handoff documents.

**Note:** This is my first project in VS Code on Mac. Help me with any setup if needed.

**Start by reading:** `VSCODE_HANDOFF_2026-01-28.md`

**Three tasks in order:**

0. **Organize folder structure (first thing)** — Files are currently flat. Help me reorganize into proper Python package structure (`picobot/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `.github/`). Create `__init__.py` files, fix imports, verify everything works.

1. **GitHub repo setup** — After reorganizing, initialize git, polish README for GitHub, create repo, and push. **Deliverable: public repo URL** (needed before I can publish my blog post).

2. **Optimization work** — After the repo is live, we'll optimize the simulator. This is both a learning project for me (NumPy, profiling, vectorization) and material for a future blog post. Guide is in `OPTIMIZATION_ACTIVITY_2026-01-27.md`. Document surprises and learnings as we go.

**Key files to reference:**
- `VSCODE_HANDOFF_2026-01-28.md` — Task details and file mappings
- `PROJECT_STATUS_2026-01-28.md` — Full project context  
- `OPTIMIZATION_ACTIVITY_2026-01-27.md` — Optimization guide
- `PEDAGOGY_NOTES_2026-01-27.md` — Educational design (for later)
- `copilot-instructions.md` — My preferences and project context

Let's start with Task 0: organizing the folder structure.
